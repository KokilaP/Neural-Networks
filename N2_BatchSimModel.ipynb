    "# Description\n",
    "This is a model which can create coupled networks of a desired type and change their parameters to observe which of them affect synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "It carries out the following functions:\n",
    "    1. Create individual network groups with their synapses --> uses BrianVis.network_indv(...)\n",
    "    2. Create synapse group of coupled networks with monitors to record each network --> BrianVis.network_coupling(..)\n",
    "    3. Make changes to individual parameters of network groups, synapses and run times\n",
    "    4. Run the coupled networks in the following pattern:\n",
    "               a. Disconnected networks for a time t1*s: coupled synaptic weights will be zero\n",
    "               b. Connected(coupled) networks for a time t2*s: coupled synaptic weights reset to values obtained in step 2\n",
    "               c. Disconnected networks for a time t1*s: coupled synaptic weights set to zero again\n",
    "    5. Output spikemonitor voltages and times so they can be graphed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals:\n",
    "- To simulate coupled networks while varying their parameters\n",
    "- To observe network behavior in coupled vs uncoupled states"
